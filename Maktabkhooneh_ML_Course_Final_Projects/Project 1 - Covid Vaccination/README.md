# 🌍 COVID-19 Vaccination Trend Prediction – Final ML Project

This project is a final assignment for a MAKTABKHOONEH machine learning course. The objective is to build a model that predicts the number of COVID-19 vaccines administered using real-world data.

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a machine learning model that:
- Predicts the number of vaccines administered
- Cleans, prepares, and analyzes data effectively
- Selects the most suitable features and model
- Visualizes insights and model performance

This project also emphasizes **storytelling** and clear presentation of insights, as would be expected from a professional **Data Scientist**.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Typical libraries used include:
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn`

### ✅ Step 2: Data Loading and EDA
- Load the dataset using **Pandas**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand structure, distribution, and patterns

### ✅ Step 3: Data Cleaning
- Detect and handle **missing values**
- Apply necessary **data cleaning techniques**
- Apply **feature scaling** if required

### ✅ Step 4: Data Visualization
- Use **Seaborn** or **Matplotlib** to generate visualizations
- Analyze **feature correlations** to guide feature selection

### ✅ Step 5: Data Preparation
- Split data into **training and testing sets**
- Identify **input features** and **target variable**

### ✅ Step 6: Model Training
- Train a model using the selected algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Plot **error metrics** and performance curves using libraries like `Seaborn` or `Matplotlib`

### ✅ Step 7: Model Saving and Final Submission
- Save the trained model
- Submit final code and notebook via **Jupyter Notebook**
- Upload the completed project to the Maktabkhooneh platform

## 📌 Notes

- You may choose any country with sufficient data to test the model.
- Ensure the data is real and valid for meaningful insights.
- The project simulates real-world conditions for building machine learning pipelines as a **Data Scientist**.
